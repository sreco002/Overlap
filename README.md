# Overlap
*This is a display of my research for the degree exhibition Overlap
My aim is to present an installation for people to connect with each other in a playful way
If two people look at each other, an animation is created.
They have to match each other faces in order to control the animation on the face of each other*

In the bin
a journey under the umbrella, maybe for a next exhibition , references to the Situationist movement in opposition of surrealist

Useful algorithms
Path finder : Travelsales men strategy or Dijkstra's Algorithm

Strategy

Investigate the problem of **Eye tracking**

21 june
Documentation : start github to organise resources

Crit sessions : Irini Papadimitriou V&A curator for digital works ,( http://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/news-learning-department/digital-futures-e-stitches soft computing)situationist movement, stanza (http://www.stanza.co.uk/sonicity/index.html Stanza)
Atau : investigate more in the gaze proposition in oppition to the journey under the umbrella
my feeling : focus on the gaze state , more adapted to a degree show


Coding 

**ofxDlib to use faceTracker** for two people at the same time, have to check if it is doing for profiles too or only face

**TravelSales men strategy with genetic algorithm with CodingTrain** , how about using people gazing or not as a mutation factor in this strategy? 

1. one


2. two
