# Overlap
**This is a display of my research for the degree exhibition Overlap**

## What is it?
An installation for people to connect with each other in a playful way


## How does it work?
If two people look at each other, an animation is created.
They have to match each other faces in order to control the animation on the face of each other

## What is the outcome?

Eye contact - make things move

Strategy

Investigate the problem of **Eye tracking**


Documentation : start github to organise resources

Crit sessions : Irini Papadimitriou V&A curator for digital works ,( http://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/news-learning-department/digital-futures-e-stitches soft computing)situationist movement, stanza (http://www.stanza.co.uk/sonicity/index.html Stanza)
Atau : investigate more in the gaze proposition in oppition to the journey under the umbrella
my feeling : focus on the gaze state , more adapted to a degree show


Coding 

**ofxDlib to use faceTracker** for two people at the same time, have to check if it is doing for profiles too or only face

**TravelSales men strategy with genetic algorithm with CodingTrain** , how about using people gazing or not as a mutation factor in this strategy? 



In the bin
a journey under the umbrella, maybe for a next exhibition , references to the Situationist movement in opposition of surrealist
Thoughts after feedback : Fail to make it interesting to curators, Too complicate and unclear outcome
What was it?
People will navigate under an umbrella , unseen 

How does it work?
they will listen to instructions to navigate through the exhibition
instructions from the computer. They will also hear poems when they will be located at certain positions
They will pass the umbrella to another person who will continue the journey

What is the outcome?
Me and the other, no Eye contact
Eye contact only when exchanging umbrella
Useful algorithms
Path finder : Travelsales men strategy or Dijkstra's Algorithm

It is like Marina Abramovich, offering her gaze to people
